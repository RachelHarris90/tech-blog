    "body": "The most important addition in React 18 is something we hope you never have to think about: concurrency. We think this is largely true for application developers, though the story may be a bit more complicated for library maintainers. Concurrency is not a feature, per se.

    "title": "New Feature: Automatic Batching",
    "body": "Batching is when React groups multiple state updates into a single re-render for better performance. Without automatic batching, we only batched updates inside React event handlers. Updates inside of promises, setTimeout, native event handlers, or any other event were not batched in React by default. Source: https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18.html"

    "body": "In this release we took the opportunity to redesign the APIs we expose for rendering on the client and server. These changes allow users to continue using the old APIs in React 17 mode while they upgrade to the new APIs in React 18. Source: https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18.html"
